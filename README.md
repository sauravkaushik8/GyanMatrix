GyanMatrix organised a Data Science competition consisting of Exploratory Data Analysis of records from gaming industry and building an interpretable model to find out what are the strongest predictors that affect whether a newly released game will win an award or not.

I used R Markdown to efiiciently convey my code with its outputs in form of plots and graphs. since this was a subjective round, there was no leaderboard.
